# Immanuel Peter - Computer Science Student at the University of Chicago | Aspiring ML/AI Engineer

## About me
- Freshman at the University of Chicago studying Computer Science (possibly also Physics)
- Interested in software development, neural network training, and machine learning model deployment

## My goals
- Short term: become a Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence Engineering intern during college
- Long term: found many developer-friendly companies and become a serial entrepreneur/technologist

- Overview: Stack Overflow with added video conferencing functionality to speed development and make coding human again!

### Planning to Work On

#### Academic Path-Planning GNN (Graph Neural Network)
- Learning about whether academic path planning in college can have applications utilizing GNNs
- Likely tech stack would be
  - PyTorch (PyTorch Geometric) or TensorFlow (TensorFlow GNN) for model training and deployment
  - Flask for calling and using the model to generate output
  - React for frontend UI to capture input
