## 💡 About Me

- **Student at the University of Chicago** pursuing a BS in Computer Science and a BA in Physics (expected 2028).
- Focused on building **scalable, production-grade software** and **deployable AI/ML systems**, with a strong foundation in systems, math, and engineering ownership.
- Actively seeking **Software Engineering** or **AI/ML Engineering** internship roles for Summer 2026.

## ✨ Flagship Engineering Work

These projects showcase demonstrated technical ownership, architecture, and real-world impact.

### 1. Edusphere Matchbox

[![Live Demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/Live%20Demo-eduspheretech-blueviolet?style=for-the-badge&logo=vercel)](https://matchbox.eduspheretech.com)

- **AI-Driven Research Matchmaking Platform:** A scalable, serverless application that intelligently matches students to research labs using **semantic search** and **LLM-based compatibility scoring** to replace the cold-email process.
- **Production Architecture (GCP):** Architected the entire solution on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using **Cloud Run** and **Cloud Load Balancing**, orchestrated with **Terraform (IaC)** for reproducible deployment.
- **Technical Stack:** Built a modern full-stack application with **Next.js 15 (React 19)** and a high-concurrency **FastAPI** backend, utilizing **ChromaDB** for vector storage and **Firestore** for data persistence.
- **Impact:** Currently in pilot at the University of Chicago; designed for scaling to address academic communication and efficiency across higher education.

### 2. AutoMoE – Modular Self-Driving System & Datasets

[![Multimodal Dataset](https://img.shields.io/badge/HuggingFace-Multimodal%20Dataset-yellow?style=for-the-badge&logo=huggingface)](https://huggingface.co/datasets/immanuelpeter/carla-autopilot-multimodal-dataset)

- **Core System:** Developed a modular **Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)** architecture for autonomous driving in the CARLA simulator, utilizing specialized expert networks and a gating network for decision-making. Built with **PyTorch (DDP), CUDA, and Linux**.
- **Data Contribution:** The project's pipeline resulted in two large-scale, public datasets for the autonomous driving research community:
    - **CARLA Autopilot Multimodal Dataset** (~365 GB, 82k frames): Synchronized RGB, semantic segmentation, LiDAR, 2D boxes, and ego-vehicle states.
    - **CARLA Autopilot Images Dataset** (~188 GB, 68k frames): Multi-camera images, control signals, and kinematics.
- **Status & Learnings:** Currently paused. The process provided deep expertise in high-performance data pipelines, distributed training, and the challenges of deploying AI systems.

## 💼 Experience Highlights

### Software Engineering Intern, Quantum Rings (Summer 2025)

- **Ownership & Impact:** Drove reliability and scalability improvements by **diagnosing and fixing critical backend failures** and executing major schema refactoring with zero downtime.
- **Scalable Systems Design:** Designed and deployed a **queue-driven execution processing** system to decouple heavy telemetry operations from the API, significantly **reducing request latency** and enabling horizontal scaling.
- **Full-Stack Development:** Developed full-stack admin analytics dashboards (**NestJS, Next.js, Recharts**) with SQL time-bucket aggregation, providing **actionable insights** into user growth and execution volume.
- **Reliable Data Flow:** Implemented a **fault-tolerant, SQS-based background worker** for telemetry aggregation and HubSpot CRM synchronization, ensuring reliable data delivery for downstream analytics and sales pipelines.
- **Metrics & Observability:** Introduced circuit execution metrics (complexity, duration) and a KPI dashboard for **UTM-based marketing attribution**, directly supporting growth strategy.
